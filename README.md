# Dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles in my home directory. Feel free to use any of these configuration files as you wish. Any contribution is appreciated!

## My VIMRC

### Colorschemes

I've used many different colorschemes but only 2 have managed to keep me sane over the long term. [Dracula](https://github.com/dracula/vim) and [Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) (Dark). I switch between the two whenever I get tired or bored of one. Below is a picture of each:

### Eliminating Bad Habits

I disabled the arrow keys in both **Normal** and **Insert** modes. Moving around the file with **HJKL** is much more efficient. There are other mappings for efficient navigation too that I use quite often:

* **CTRL-F**: Scroll one page down
* **CTRL-B**: Scroll one page up
* **zz**: Place the current line at the center of the window

Another bad habit I used to have was exiting the **Insert** mode using the `<esc>` key. The `<esc>` key is a far reach for the pinky on the left hand and it's important to exit the insert mode and save the changes every few seconds or so. That's why I use `jk` to exit the **Insert** mode instead. The mouse buttons and scrolling functionalities are also disabled in my VIMRC.
