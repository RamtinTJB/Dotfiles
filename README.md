### Eliminating Bad Habits

I disabled the arrow keys in both **Normal** and **Insert** modes. Moving around the file with **HJKL** is much more efficient. There are other mappings for efficient navigation too that I use quite often:

* **<CTRL-F>**: Scroll one page down
* **<CTRL-B>**: Scroll one page up
* **zz**: Place the current line at the center of the window

Another bad habit I used to have was exiting the **Insert** mode using the `<esc>` key. The `<esc>` key is a far reach for the pinky on the left hand and it's important to exit the insert mode and save the changes every few seconds or so. That's why I use `jk` to exit the **Insert** mode instead. The mouse buttons and scrolling functionalities are also disabled in my VIMRC.
